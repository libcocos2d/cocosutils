Compatibility.

Should we maintain some form of compatibility with cocos2d-console ?

This is the info on creating a new plugin for that project
So we could design something that covers both models

```python
import cocos

# Plugins should be a sublass of CCPlugin
class CCPluginDeploy(cocos.CCPlugin):

		# in default category
        @staticmethod
        def plugin_category():
          return ""

        @staticmethod
        def plugin_name():
          return "deploy"

        @staticmethod
        def brief_description():
            return "Deploy the project to target."                

        def run(self, argv, dependencies):
            print "plugin called!"
            print argv

```
